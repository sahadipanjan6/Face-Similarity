This small project is all about finding the similarities of two faces. For doing this project, there are basic software requirements which are stated below:

1. Keras
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy

The whole notebook consists of different sections. In the FIRST section, face detection have been done using the Bounding Boxes on the photos which are uploaded in this project. In the SECOND section, the detected faces have been extracted from the whole image. In the THIRD section, the similarities between the two extracted faces have been found out using the Cosine Similarity algorithm.
